## Loops Lab

1.  Write a `for` loop that will iterate from 50 to 20.
For each iteration, if the current number is a multiple of 3, console.log the value.


2.  Write out an "infinite loop" below. Don't run the loop in your console unless you are prepared to force quit your browser!! Check with the instructor to see if it is, or live dangerously and crash your browser!

3.  Loop through this array and print every other value, starting with the second.

```javascript
const presidents = ["Donald", "Barack", "George Jr", "Bill", "George", "Ronald", "Jimmy", "Gerald", "Richard", "Lyndon", "John", "Dwight", "Harry", "Franklin", "Herbert", "Calvin", "Warren", "Woodrow", "William", "Theodore"];
```

4.  Create a new array with the gluten-free options from this menu:

```javascript
const menu = [{name: "pizza", glutenFree: false},{name: "salad", glutenFree: true},{name: "donut", glutenFree: false},{name: "steak", glutenFree: true},{name: "chicken", glutenFree: true},{name: "cheeseburger", glutenFree: false}];
```

5.  Loop through the following array and push the items that are not numbers
into a seperate array

`const mixedArray = [1, 2, 3, 'taco', 4, 5, 6, 'burrito', 7, 8, 9, 'Whats the deal with airplane peanuts', 3.14, {barry: "Mannilow",}, 6, 55, null, "Old " + "Crow " + " Medicine Show", 3, 2, "I want the calzone from pizanos", "Death blow", "Firestorm", "48", 30]`

### Bonus Question(hard mode)
Create a new array with all the players that have a true value of goat (greatest of all time) from each league.

```javascript
const league = [{name: "NFL", players: [{name: "Tom Brady", goat: false}, {name: "Walter Payton", goat: true}]}, {name: "NBA", players: [{name: "Michael Jordan", goat: true}, {name: "Lebron James", goat: false}]},{name: "MLB", players: [{name: "Babe Ruth", goat: true}, {name: "Alex Rodriguez", goat: false}]}]
```
